# Sorting-Visulizer
# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application that helps users understand and visualize popular sorting algorithms. It provides a graphical representation of how different sorting algorithms work step-by-step to sort a list of numbers. This tool is ideal for students, educators, and anyone interested in learning more about sorting algorithms and their behavior.

## Features

- Visualizes multiple sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Adjustable speed controls for animations
- Customizable array size and values
- Step-by-step visualization of each sorting process
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface

## Demo

You can try the live demo by downloading and running the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krunalkapadi/Sorting-Visulizer.git
   cd Sorting-Visulizer
   ```
2. Unzip the `sorting-visualizer-master.zip` file if present:
   ```bash
   unzip sorting-visualizer-master.zip
   cd sorting-visualizer-master
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

## Usage

- Select a sorting algorithm from the menu.
- Adjust the array size and animation speed as needed.
- Click "Generate New Array" to create a new random array.
- Click "Start" to begin the visualization and watch how the algorithm sorts the array step by step.

## Supported Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

(More algorithms can be added in the future!)
